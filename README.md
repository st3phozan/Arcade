Objective: Learn Git and GitHub

Background:
We talked about decision trees last week. Decision trees are when a specific event is triggered based on certain conditions. This can be a decision that is made by a player or actions taken by other entities in a game based on a condition. 

Decision Tree with If Else:
In programing, there are if-else statements that analyze a current condition, and perform certain actions based on that condition. Each decision in a decision tree is like an if-else statement in code. For example, a pong decision tree could look a little bit like this in code:

Instructions:
1. Fork and clone this remote repository to create a development environment on your computer
2. Pick an existing game and make 3 simplified decision trees inspired by events in the game. (sometimes it's easier to draw it out first)
3. Modify the code template I give you within Visual Studio Code. 
4. Use the correct git command to move your changes from the working directory to the staging area. 
5. Use the correct git command to commit the changes WITH a message about which game and characters you chose.
6. Use the correct git command to push your commit to the remote repository. 
7. Create a pull request for your commit. 

Hint: Use the cheat sheet found in files on canvas to help.
